# QQE

QQE (Quantitative Qualitative Estimation) is a custom oscillator indicator based on RSI, MA, and ATR for MT4 and MT5, coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on early versions by Roman Ignatov and Tim Hyder. QQE gives signals based on the cross of the neutral level of 50.

QQE can be configured using the main smoothing factor and alert parameters.
